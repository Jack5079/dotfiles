        # Pros

        - Only handles alignment, direction, and distribution
        - Edits and maintenance are all in one spot
        - Gap guarantees equal spacing amongst n children

        # Cons

        - Most lines of code

        # Pros

        - Content is centered even under constrained space and overflow
        - Centering edits and maintenance are all in one spot
        - Gap guarantees equal spacing amongst n children

        # Cons

        - The widest child (max-content) sets the width for all the rest

        # Pros

        - Useful
        - Reliable
        - When you need it, itâ€™s invaluable

        # Cons

        - Code with negative percentage values
        - Requires `position: relative` to force a containing block
        - Early and awkward line breaks
        - There can be only 1 per containing block without additional effort
